_steamCouponBot_
================
_A Steam bot inspired by the [Dota 2 Dispenser][0] that handles coupons instead_

Installation Procedure
----------------------
Windows:

1. Download the [node.js][1] **binary** for your OS' bitness and put it in a folder called 'nodejs'
2. Download the latest version of npm from [http://nodejs.org/dist/npm/][2] and unpack it to the nodejs folder (where node.exe is)
3. Follow the instructions at [this page][3] to properly install and configure Visual Studio 2010
4. Set up [ursa][4]'s dependencies [listed here][5]
5. Install ursa by opening a command window in the nodejs folder and executing `npm install ursa`
6. Install the [steam][6] module the same way using `npm install steam`
7. You've just installed all of steamCouponBot's dependencies, but as this is a really early WIP project, the install instructions for the bot itself have yet to be written
